The next settlers were pirates who believed that a planet free from laws and constraints would be a great base of operations.","	The anarchist farming communes, each operating independently but trading with outsiders to gain necessary supplies, are clustered in the barely temperate climate near the equator. The pirate bases, having a much more ready source of supplies, are located wherever there are flat landing areas close to craggy, defensible mountains.","spaceport","You are glad you put on a warm coat before leaving your ship.

Aside from tourism, most of the planet's income is from petroleum mining.","	The forests are home to a stunning variety of wildlife, some of it dangerous but most of it entirely indifferent to human presence. Plant life is so abundant here that even the oceans are green rather than blue, teeming with kelp and algae.","spaceport","The Amazon spaceport is unique, built on top of tall pillars more than fifty meters above the ground, directly above the forest canopy.

Occasional stampedes, involving tens of thousands of these animals, have been known to level entire towns here.","	Aside from hunting, most of the industry takes the form of harvesting and refining petrochemicals to make plastics, polymers, and oils. In some parts of Arabia, the pumpjacks outnumber the people a hundred to one.","spaceport","The spaceport consists mostly of a wide, open field paved in asphalt, the cheapest material available here. The pavement shimmers with heat, and is pockmarked with divots where ships' landing gear has sunk several centimeters in to the surface.","	At the center of the pavement is a small cluster of refrigerated sheds and stacks of crates carrying various goods for trade; a few armed guards patrol around them to prevent theft.

It is here that they built their capital, in a deep valley that is almost always shrouded in clouds. In meadows farther up the mountain slopes, a few particularly hardy food crops are grown, but for the most part the Remnant relies on artificial greenhouses or cultured yeast for protein supplements. Remnant cuisine is unlikely to ever become a draw for tourists, even if their isolation here is broken.","spaceport","The oldest buildings in the Remnant capital city harken back to classic human architecture, with stone facades and columns reminiscent of ancient Rome. But as you walk outward toward the more recent additions, the buildings become less and less recognizably human, with curved organic shapes and hundreds of overhanging walkways and balconies. It is as if the layers left behind by centuries of habitation are a frozen record of the slow transition of Remnant culture into something bizarre and almost alien.","bribe","0","shipyard","Remnant","outfitter","Remnant"},

It is also home to House Plumtab, the Arach guild in charge of banks and finance. Because pretty much every other sector of the Arach economy depends on loans from House Plumtab and trades stock on their equity exchanges, this House is quite influential throughout Arach space.","spaceport","The central concourse of the spaceport is reminiscent of a major stock exchange on a human world, with video screens everywhere displaying constantly fluctuating line graphs and lists of numbers and symbols. The only difference is that the graphs run top to bottom, rather than left to right.","	Every once in a while, one of the Arachi will cause a minor pedestrian traffic jam by abruptly stopping to look at one of the displays.","shipyard","Coalition Basics","Arach","outfitter","Coalition Advanced"},

Most of the industry here focuses on mining metals and exotic elements to be used in building new extensions to the Rings. There is also a Saryd materials research lab trying to learn how to duplicate the advanced composites used by the Quarg. But Belug's Plunge is best known for the Academy, where cadets for the Heliarch defense forces are trained.","spaceport","The central spaceport terminal is a large chamber with a hushed atmosphere reminiscent of a library's reading room. In small nooks along the periphery, small groups are engaged in quiet conversation. Most cargo is carried by robotic carts, wheeling around on a floor so smooth that the only time they make noise is when they politely speak up to warn people to get out of their way.","	Occasionally a group of cadets wearing yellow baldrics marches through, stepping as lightly as they can to avoid disturbing the quiet.","outfitter","Coalition Advanced"},

It would be an ideal farming world if it were not for the fact that the native plants are so abundant and so well adapted to this environment that they can take over an untended field in a matter of months. Farmers typically start the growing season by slashing and burning the plants that have taken root in their fields over the winter, and even so they must be constantly vigilant for weeds throughout the summer.","	The Big Sky government recently financed a major project to genetically engineer a goat species so ravenous that it can control the growth of local vegetation. These 'ubergoats' pose so great a threat to the typical biosphere that they are export-controlled as biological weapons.","spaceport","The landing pads here are being gradually consumed by the local plant life. In most places grass and ivy has crept out to cover at least a meter of the pad on all sides, and every small crack or crevice has been colonized by moss and by the roots of larger plants. In places the forest has been cleared to make roads leading to the nearby farming villages, but in most directions all you see is green.

Today, Vinci is the foremost manufacturer of CPUs in all of human space, and their processors are found in everything from navigational computers to video phones to intelligent toasters. Because this world is home to so many cleanroom fabrication plants, pollution is very tightly controlled.","spaceport","The spaceport is so full of high-fidelity holographic displays that you have trouble at times telling where the virtual reality ends and the physical reality begins; what looks like a paper poster on the wall will suddenly change to a different picture every minute, and the department store mannequins follow you with their eyes.

Most of the fields are tilled and harvested by robots, but there are also many scattered homesteads of subsistence farmers, who survive with the aid of little or no technology.","	In recent years, both the land and the seas of Warfeed have begun to show the toll of centuries of overharvesting. Large portions of the continents near the equator are now nothing but growing deserts, and even the best remaining farmland is sandy and nutrient-poor. All but the smallest marine organisms have been nearly fished to extinction.","spaceport","This spaceport is a collection of ramshackle wooden buildings and packed dirt landing pads. The wagons piled high with produce and bags of grain would not look out of place in many human ports, but they are being drawn by giant lizards instead of horses or oxen. There are no human beings here, and most of the Hai eye you with suspicion and distaste."},

The trees have evolved deep and strong roots that can pierce through the limestone into the subterranean rivers in order to draw a constant supply of water even in the dry seasons. The Saryds have explored only a tiny fraction of the caves.","spaceport","The spaceport village is built on a volcanic highland where the inhabitants do not need to worry about their houses disappearing overnight into one of the limestone sinkholes that pockmark this planet's tropics. In place of trees, the village is full of trellised arches and spires; vines grow on the trellises, and moss grows on the vines, watered by the fog that sweeps up every evening from the rainforest below.","required reputation","15"},

Instead of square angles it has many curved walls and domes. The landing pads jut out from the building at various heights. Some of the landing pads are designed with docking tubes specifically for Quarg visitors, and the ceilings are unusually high to accommodate the Quarg, several of whom are walking around and mingling with the humans here.","shipyard","Basic Ships","Tarazed Basics","Tarazed Advanced","Southbound Basics","outfitter","Delta V Advanced","Kraz Advanced","Common Outfits","Ammo South","bribe","0.07","security","0.3","tribute","1700","threshold","5000","fleet","Large Militia26"},

Nearly all the life in the oceans is very close to the surface, where the sun's light is bright enough for algae and seaweed to flourish.","	A few of the larger islands have been settled by the Arachi, and most of the locals work in the fishing industry. Some of the fishing boats are so large that a small starship can land on their decks.","spaceport","The spaceport is on an island near one of the planet's poles, where the temperature is cool and sea ice can be gathered to stock the warehouses where the fish are kept cold until they can be shipped offworld.

There seems to be almost no interest in the affairs of the wider galaxy.","spaceport","The spaceport is in one of the main cities, and is built partly on land and partly on piers that stretch out into the harbor, so that cargo can be brought to the port by truck or by barge. There are even a few runways for aircraft, in addition to the landing pads for starships. In the wharf area, fresh cooked fish and sushi are sold from a small cluster of wooden huts. Farther inland, cargo crates are stacked under the immense tents that serve as warehouses.

The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going.","	The temperatures have risen measurably since the arrival of the human colonists, but without more intentional efforts it may be another century before the planet warms enough to be truly comfortable to live on.","spaceport","The spaceport is built on a large rock outcropping, with brilliant blue glaciers flowing to either side down into a lake below. The sight is stunning, and all the more appealing because you are able to view it from behind plate glass windows, in the warmth of the spaceport, rather than in the frigid air outside. Above you, several layers of clouds are scudding across the sky in different directions.","	Faded posters on the walls advise you to buy an estate on Winter now before prices skyrocket.

It has, however, one major advantage as a place to settle: it is far enough away that the Republic makes no attempt to control it.","	Several villages have been founded near the equator, and in addition there are an unknown number of private holdings, ranging from underground bunkers to enormous cement fortresses. Because the land is owned by no government and anyone can build a dwelling without permission or paperwork as long as they are willing to fight off any other claimants, the total population of Zenith is unknown.","spaceport","To create a spaceport for Zenith, one enterprising privateer a few centuries ago used a mixture of explosives and heavy machinery to shift the top of one of the tallest mountains down into the neighboring valleys, creating a high plateau that is (usually) above the fog line. There are landing pads both for starships like yours and for airships that carry cargo to and from the settlements elsewhere on the planet.

At its core is the 'Old Port,' a set of quaint and rudimentary shops and warehouses. The landing pads for the Old Port were torn up to make room for what the locals call 'The Port,' a set of buildings that were constructed a century ago, with bolder architecture and more modern design. Some distance away is the 'New Port,' a towering structure with robotic cargo lifts and large hangars for more expensive ships.
